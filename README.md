# IoT Project – Smart School Network & Impact in Football

This repository includes an IoT project developed as part of an exploration into how Internet of Things (IoT) technology can be applied in both educational and sports environments.

## 🔌 1. Smart School Network (Cisco Packet Tracer)

I created a **Cisco Packet Tracer** file that simulates a smart school network. The simulation includes connected devices such as:
- temperature sensors  
- surveillance cameras  
- smart display panels  
- digitally controlled doors  

The purpose of this simulation is to showcase my vision of how IoT devices can be integrated into a modern educational institution to improve security, energy efficiency, and the overall learning experience.

## 📊 2. Scientific Research – The Impact of IoT in Football

I also conducted a **scientific research project** focused on the impact of IoT in football. The paper analyzes how IoT contributes to:
- monitoring player performance  
- injury prevention  
- enhancing training sessions using real-time data  

This part of the project includes:
- a **LaTeX document** with the research content  
- a **PowerPoint presentation** used for oral presentation of the topic  

Project Structure
├── scientific_research.pdf         (Scientific research in LaTeX)
├── Scientific_research_slides.pptx (PowerPoint presentation for the scientific research)
└── iot_smart_school.pkt            (Smart School project made in Cisco Packet Tracer)


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** – for simulating the smart school network  
- **LaTeX** – for typesetting the scientific research paper  
- **Microsoft PowerPoint** – for creating the project presentation
