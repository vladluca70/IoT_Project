IoT Project – Smart School Network & Impact in Football
This repository includes an IoT project developed as part of an exploration into how Internet of Things technology can be applied in both educational and sports environments.

🔌 1. Smart School Network (Cisco Packet Tracer)
I created a Cisco Packet Tracer file that simulates a smart school network. The simulation includes connected devices such as:

temperature sensors

surveillance cameras

smart display panels

digitally controlled doors

The goal of this simulation is to present my vision of how IoT devices can be integrated into a modern educational institution to enhance security, energy efficiency, and the overall student experience.

📊 2. Scientific Research – The Impact of IoT in Football
I also conducted a scientific research project on the impact of IoT in football. The paper explores how IoT technology contributes to:

monitoring player performance

preventing injuries

enhancing training sessions through real-time data

This part of the project includes:

a LaTeX document with the written research paper

a PowerPoint presentation prepared for the oral defense of the project
